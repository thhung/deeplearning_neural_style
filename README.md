# deeplearning_neural_style
A simple implementation of neuralstyle in tensorflow. #deeplearning #tensorflow #neuralstyle 

Below is an example:

![The origial Image](content.jpg)*The origial Image*

![The style I would like to get](style.jpg) *The style I would like to get*

![Result after 160 iterations](160.png)

![The generated image](generated_image.jpg)

Of course, we can always increase the number of iteration to improve the result.
